title: Fixing the blog

Thank you to Matt Jennings for providing the template for this static blog, I can now get away with customising a sveltekit site with a reasonable posting/slug approach that might get this on google.

First task was to move the blog to a less front-of-house place on the site, breaking alot of the functionality.

Tasks so far
----------
- Black background ✅
- White text ✅
- Back button on all posts ✅
- Hashlink text green ✅
- SEO ❌

Things broken
--------------
- Light/dark mode
