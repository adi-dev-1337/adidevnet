So i've been working on setting up a podcast, and what better way to do it then to use what i've learned at the AWS Summit I attended in London this week.

The thrilling lecture on what a modern application inspired me. ASAP
- As soon as possible
- As scalable as possible
- As stingy as possible
- One more i've forgotten

\(What I'm talking about\).equals("As Serverless as possible); >> True

Amplify
-------------
The solution is AWS Amplify, leaving me to focus on the frontend of the application and the recording of the episodes.

Frustratingly all my guests don't want to be the first guest, and some want a structure.
I'm a man who follows emmergent structure, so we'll develop one as we go.


Tune into PodcastlesInTheSky, i love a play on words and we'll \(License allowing\) make callbacks to the 00's hit song by Ian Van Dahl.

[My Podcast](https://podcastlesinthesky.com)

My hope is that it is enjoyable and the first years goal is to reach 100 monthly listeners. It WILL be available on spotify.

For now please enjoy a teaser artwork created curtesy of wombo.art, we'll be using them as thumbnails.
